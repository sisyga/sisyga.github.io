Welcome to my personal page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at TU Dresden, where I specialize in applying advanced mathematical modeling to understand complex biological systems, particularly in the fields of cancer research. My work bridges the gap between theory and practical applications, using tools like cellular automata to uncover the dynamics of tumor evolution and disease spread.

My passion for science communication led me to co-author "Mathematik der Pandemie" (Mathematics of the Pandemic), a book that demystifies the mathematical models behind COVID-19 predictions for a broader audience.

With a strong foundation in both mathematics and physics, I am committed to advancing our understanding of disease processes and contributing to the development of more effective therapies. I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities to apply my skills to pressing challenges in biomedical research.

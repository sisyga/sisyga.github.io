Welcome to my personal page! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Sciences (CIDS) at TU Dresden, where I specialize in biomathematical modeling of tumor evolution and therapy response. My research focuses on understanding how genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity impacts cancer progression and treatment outcomes.

My work employs agent-based modeling, particularly cellular automata, to study complex biological systems including collective cancer cell migration, evolutionary dynamics, and therapy resistance. I regularly supervise MSc and PhD students and my research is supported by prestigious funding including ERC Advanced Grant and Worldwide Cancer Research.

My passion for science communication led me to co-author "Mathematik der Pandemie" (Mathematics of the Pandemic), a book that demystifies the mathematical models behind COVID-19 predictions for a broader audience.

With a strong foundation in both mathematics and physics, I am committed to advancing our understanding of tumor evolution and contributing to the development of more effective cancer therapies. I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities to apply mathematical modeling to pressing challenges in oncology.

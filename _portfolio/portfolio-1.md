This project, funded by an ERC Advanced Grant, aims to combine immunotherapy with classical cancer therapies at ultra-low, sublethal doses to maximize efficacy. Informed by single-cell analyses and advanced statistical inference methods, we employ mathematical modeling of intracellular damage dynamics to maximize treatment efficacy. Joint with the Peter Friedl and Johannes Textor groups (both Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands).
